# Database, Text Generation, and Prompt Handling Overview

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the database management, text generation, and prompt handling functionalities of the chatbot application.

## 1. Database Management (`DB_logic.py`)

The `DB_logic.py` file defines the `DB_logic` class, which manages database operations using `openpyxl` for an Excel-based DBMS.

### Key Components:
- **Uses `Google Generative AI (Gemini)` to generate OpenPyXL syntax dynamically.**
- **`respond(requirement)` Method:**
  - Receives user queries regarding database modifications.
  - Generates `openpyxl` code to handle tasks within `data.xlsx`.
  - Ensures that:
    - Column names remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.
    - Data is sorted and appended correctly based on user requests.
  - Returns only executable `openpyxl` code.

## 2. Text Generation (`generator.py`)

The `generator.py` file defines the `writer` class, responsible for generating text content.

### Key Components:
- **Utilizes `Google Generative AI (Gemini)` to generate text-based responses.**
- **`respond(requirement)` Method:**
  - Accepts a user prompt.
  - Passes it to the Gemini model to generate textual output.
  - Returns the generated response.

## 3. Prompt Handling (`prompt_handler.py`)

The `prompt_handler.py` file defines the `program_response` class, which categorizes user input and extracts structured information.

### Key Components:
- **Uses `Google Generative AI (Gemini)` to analyze and classify user queries.**
- **`respond(usr_inp)` Method:**
  - Processes user input to determine its intent.
  - Returns a JSON object containing:
    - `prompt_requirement`: A brief summary of the request.
    - `category`: Classifies input as `Database`, `Scrapper`, or `Generation`.
    - `action`: Extracts the required action (e.g., `update`, `scrape`, `generate`).
    - `scrapper_requirement`: Extracts details for scraping, including first name, last name, and domain (if mentioned).
  - Ensures output is strictly formatted as a valid JSON object.

## 4. Integration and Workflow
1. User submits a query.
2. `program_response` processes the input and categorizes it.
3. If the query relates to the database, `DB_logic` generates `openpyxl` code to modify `data.xlsx`.
4. If text generation is required, `writer` produces a response.
5. The final output is returned in structured form.

## 5. Future Enhancements
- Improve prompt classification for better accuracy.
- Expand `DB_logic` functionality to support more database actions.
- Enhance text generation capabilities with advanced formatting and context awareness.
